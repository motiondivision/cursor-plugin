# Changelog

## [7.0.0] 2026-07-28

### Changed

-   The AI Kit is now open source. The Cursor plugin and the `motion-ai` installer live together in this repository and share one set of skills.
-   MCP: Moved to Motion's hosted servers, `mcp.motion.dev` and `mcp.motion.dev/plus`. There is no local server and no API key: Motion+ features unlock by signing in from your agent.
-   Installer: `npx motion-ai` no longer asks for a Motion+ API key. It installs the skills and configures both MCP servers for Claude Code, Cursor, Amp, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Copilot or any custom agent folder.

-   Transition editor: Delay control, matching the VS Code extension.

### Removed

-   Installer: Windsurf removed from the agent picker.
