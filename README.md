# Motion AI Kit

Motion AI Kit is a suite of animation tools to help agents write production-grade animations.

## Features

**Animation best practices:** Hand-written advice by the creator of Motion for taste and technical best practices.

**The best Motion context:** The full and latest Motion documentation is made available for your agent to search. [Motion+](https://motion.dev/plus) members gain additional access to search the source code of 450+ Motion Examples and Motion UI components.

**CSS spring generation:** Use Motion to generate spring animations for CSS via the `linear()` easing.

**MotionScore performance audits (Motion+):** Run static code and runtime analysis on a specific animation, component or page, graded by S to F, and fix with customised recommendations. The audit methodology is served live to your agent from the Motion+ MCP server, so every audit follows the current MotionScore scoring engine.

src/Sheet.tsx:34 — Tier D
What:     `height` transition on `.sheet-panel`
Why:      height triggers layout, then paint, then composite, every frame
Upgrade:  Motion's `layout` prop (B) or a `scaleY` transform (S)
```

## Install

In Cursor, open **Customize** from the sidebar, search the marketplace for **Motion**, and install. That's it. Write `/motion` and ask to search docs and generate springs; sign in with Motion+ to run audits and fetch source code.

## Motion+

**[Motion+](https://motion.dev/plus)** adds MotionScore performance audits, the ability to search early access and Motion+ API documentation, plus source code for 450+ Motion Examples and Motion UI components. Plus, an experimental visual editor for tuning transitions against a live preview and then applying via your agent.

Ask Cursor to sign you in and it hands you a link. Nothing gets pasted into
chat.
